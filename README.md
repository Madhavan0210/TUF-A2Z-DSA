# Mastering DSA with C++ - Striver A2Z DSA Sheet

## 🚀 Introduction
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. I am following the **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**, a structured roadmap covering everything from fundamentals to advanced problem-solving techniques.

## 📌 Learning Roadmap
### **Phase 1: Foundations & Warm-up**
- Mastering C++ syntax and STL (Standard Template Library)
- Understanding Time & Space Complexity Analysis

### **Phase 2: Arrays & Strings**
- Fundamental to advanced problems on Arrays and Strings
- Sorting & Searching algorithms

### **Phase 3: Recursion & Backtracking**
- Recursion techniques and problem patterns
- Implementing Backtracking solutions

### **Phase 4: Linked Lists & Stacks/Queues**
- In-depth understanding of Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Efficient implementation of Stack, Queue, and Deque operations

### **Phase 5: Trees & Graphs**
- Binary Trees, BSTs, and essential Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)

### **Phase 6: Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms**
- Step-by-step approach to solving DP problems
- Practical applications of Greedy algorithms

### **Phase 7: Advanced Topics**
- Trie, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, Bit Manipulation, and more

## 📈 Progress Tracking
I will track my progress using a **GitHub repository** with:
- ✅ Daily/weekly commits of problem solutions
- 📌 Detailed explanations and optimized approaches
- 📊 Performance analysis for different solutions
